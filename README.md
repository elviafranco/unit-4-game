# Crystal Collector 

Crystal Collector is fun and interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library. 

# How the app/game works

 * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
 
 * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
 
 * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
 
 * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
 
 * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
 
 * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
 
 * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
